# Pong

This is a re-implementation of the original Karpathy's [Atari-Pong](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/a4166c7fe253700972fcbc77e4ea32c5) Numpy based script, this time ported to TensorFlow 2.

The approach here is a bit different from Karpathy's, please refer to the [spinningup docs](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/rl_intro3.html#id8) from openAI for a thorough discussion on details.

Here's an example of the trained AI after training for roughly 15k episodes:
